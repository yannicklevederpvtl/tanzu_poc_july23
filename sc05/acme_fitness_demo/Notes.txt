After onboarding your two clusters in TSM, connect to your first cluster to deploy the app secrets, apps and the ingress gateway

In the "acme" namespace previously created and enabled with Istio 

    kubectl apply -f acme_fitness_demo/kubernetes-manifests/secrets.yaml -n acme

Edit the acme_fitness_demo/kubernetes-manifests/acme_fitness_cluster1.yaml at the variable CATALOG_HOST to use the domain that you configured in your gns

    kubectl apply -f acme_fitness_demo/kubernetes-manifests/acme_fitness_cluster1.yaml -n acme

    kubectl apply -f acme_fitness_demo/istio-manifests/gateway.yaml -n acme

Connect to your second cluster to deploy the app secrets, catalog app 

In the "acme" namespace previously created and enabled with Istio 

    kubectl apply -f acme_fitness_demo/kubernetes-manifests/secrets.yaml -n acme

    kubectl apply -f acme_fitness_demo/kubernetes-manifests/acme_fitness_cluster2.yaml -n acme

Now you can create you gns and map the two clusters and acme namespace

To generate traffic you can deploy a locus deployment in your first cluster

    kubectl apply -f acme_fitness_demo/traffic-generator/traffic-generator/loadgen.yaml -n acme
